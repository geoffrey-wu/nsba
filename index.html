        <p>
            The <strong>National Science Bowl Association</strong> (NSBA) is a league-style tournament inspired by the NBA
            starting <strong>June 11th</strong>. 60 players will register and 12 general managers will draft their team of 5 and compete
            in the regular season and the playoffs for cash prizes. There will be an all-star game, trades, home court
            advantage, awards and much more. This will truly be a competition <em>like no other</em>. (Except for SBL and the
            NBA.)
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Price</strong> - Each player and manager will have to pay $5 for registration. <strong>100%</strong> of the money will be going
            towards the prize pool as well as extra cash from the organizers bumping the expected prize pool of $400+.
            The winning team will win a minimum of <strong>$280</strong> and runner up <strong>$140</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Format</strong> - This tournament is open for all age groups, and will include 11 regular season games. The top 6
            will be guaranteed into the playoffs, while the next 4 teams will play for the remaining 2 spots. Teams in
            the playoffs will play best of 5 matches on half packets. This tournament will be nationals RR level for the
            regular season and jump to nationals DE for the playoffs. We recommend participants to be prepared for a
            relatively more difficult tournament.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Spectators</strong> - One of our goals is to create an exciting atmosphere for spectators to follow the competition.
            We will have a weekly pick'em competition, the overall winner of which will receive $10. In addition, all
            matches will be filmed and released at the end of the round, and one highlighted match will be streamed.
